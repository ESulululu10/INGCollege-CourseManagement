# **INGCollege Course Management System**

## **Project Description**  
The Course Management System (INGCollege) is a Java-based desktop application designed to manage academic and non-academic courses. This application provides an intuitive **Graphical User Interface (GUI)** for adding, registering, removing, and displaying courses. All data is stored in an `ArrayList`, demonstrating the use of collection frameworks and object-oriented principles.  

This project showcases Java development skills, including GUI design using Swing and AWT, inheritance, and error handling.
